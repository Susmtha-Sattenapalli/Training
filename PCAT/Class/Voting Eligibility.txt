Voting Eligibility Checker:

 Create a program that determines whether a person is eligible to vote in an election based on the following criteria:
●	Age must be 18 or above.
●	Must be a citizen of the country.
●	Prompt the user to input their age, citizenship status (yes/no), and felony status (yes/no), and then use complex logical expressions to determine and output whether they are eligible to vote.

int main() {
    int age;
    char citizenship, felony;

    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);

    printf("Are you a citizen of the country? (yes/no): ");
    scanf(" %c", &citizenship);

    printf("Have you committed any felonies? (yes/no): ");
    scanf(" %c", &felony);

    b= (age >= 18) && (citizenship == 'y' || citizenship == 'Y') && (felony == 'n' || felony == 'N');

    if (eligible) {
        printf("You are eligible to vote.\n");
    } else {
        printf("You are not eligible to vote.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
