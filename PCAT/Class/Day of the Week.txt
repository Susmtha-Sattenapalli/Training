Day of the Week:

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number between 1 and 7 representing a day of the week (1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, and so on). Use a switch statement to determine the day entered by the user and output the corresponding day name. If the user enters a number outside the range of 1-7, display an error message

int main() {
    int dayNumber;

    printf("Enter a number between 1 and 7: ");
    scanf("%d", &dayNumber);

    switch (dayNumber) {
        case 1:
            printf("Sunday\n");
            break;
        case 2:
            printf("Monday\n");
            break;
        case 3:
            printf("Tuesday\n");
            break;
        case 4:
            printf("Wednesday\n");
            break;
        case 5:
              printf("Thursday\n");
            break;
        case 6:
            printf("Friday\n");
            break;
        case 7:
            printf("Saturday\n");
            break;
        default:
            printf("Error: Invalid input! Please enter a number between 1 and 7.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
