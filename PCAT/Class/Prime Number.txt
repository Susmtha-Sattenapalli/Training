Prime Number Generator:
Create a program that generates and displays all prime numbers within a specified range (e.g., between 1 and 100). Use nested loops to iterate through each number in the range and determine if it's a prime number. A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
int main ( )
    int i, j;

    for(i=2; i<100; i++)
    { 
        for(j=2; j <= (i/j); j++) 
            if(!(i%j))
                break;     // if factor found, not prime 
        if(j > (i/j))
            printf("%d is prime\n", i); 
    }

    return 0; 
}
