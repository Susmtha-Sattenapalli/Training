Product Discount Calculator:

Write a program that calculates the discount amount for a product based on the following criteria:
●	If the product price is over $100 and the customer is a premium member, they get a 20% discount.
●	If the product price is over $100 and the customer is not a premium member, they get a 10% discount.
●	If the product price is $100 or less, there is no discount.
●	Prompt the user to input the product price and their premium membership status, then use complex logical expressions to calculate and output the discount amount.

int main() {
    float price;
    char Member;
    printf("Enter the product price: ");
    scanf("%f", &price);

    printf("Are you a premium member? (yes/no): ");
    scanf(" %c", &Member);
    float discount = 0.0;

    if (price > 100) {
        if (Member == 'y' || Member == 'Y') {
            discount = 0.2 * price; // 20% discount for premium members
        } else {
            discount = 0.1 * price; // 10% discount for non-premium members
        }
    }
    if (discount > 0) {
        printf("Discount amount: $%.2f\n", discount);
    } else {
        printf("No discount applicable.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
