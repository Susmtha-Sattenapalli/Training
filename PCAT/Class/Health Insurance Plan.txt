Health Insurance Plan Eligibility:

Design a program that determines whether a person is eligible for a particular health insurance plan based on the following criteria:
●	Age must be between 18 and 65.
●	Must not have any pre-existing medical conditions.
●	Must not have any recent hospitalizations (within the last 6 months).
●	Prompt the user to input their age, medical condition status, and hospitalization status, then use complex logical expressions to determine and output whether they are eligible for the insurance plan.

   
 int main() {
    int age;
    char medicalCondition, hospitalization;
    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);
    printf("Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions? (yes/no): ");
    scanf(" %c", &medicalCondition);
    printf("Have you had any hospitalizations in the last 6 months? (yes/no): ");
    scanf(" %c", &hospitalization);

                     // Check eligibility based on criteria
                     eligible = (age >= 18 && age <= 65) &&
                    (medicalCondition == 'n' || medicalCondition == 'N') &&
                    (hospitalization == 'n' || hospitalization == 'N');

    // Output result
    if (eligible) {
        printf("You are eligible for the health insurance plan.\n");
    } else {
        printf("You are not eligible for the health insurance plan.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
