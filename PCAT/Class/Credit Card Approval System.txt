1.	Credit Card Approval System:
    Design a program that evaluates whether a person is approved for a credit card based on the following criteria:
●	Minimum credit score requirement: 700
●	Maximum debt-to-income ratio: 30%
●	No recent bankruptcies (within the last 5 years)
●	Prompt the user to input their credit score, debt amount, income amount, and bankruptcy status, then use complex logical expressions to determine and output whether they are approved for the credit card. 

import java.util.Scanner;

public class CreditCard {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("What is your credit score ?");
        int cScore = sc.nextInt();
        if(cScore > 700){
            System.out.println("What is your debt score ?");
            int debt = sc.nextInt();
            System.out.println("What is your income ?");
            int income = sc.nextInt();
            System.out.println("What is your bankruptcies status ?");
            int bStatus = sc.nextInt();
            float dti = ((float) debt /income)*100;
            System.out.println(dti);
            if(dti > 30 && bStatus >= 5){
                System.out.println("You are eligible for credit card");
            }
            else{
                System.out.println("You are not eligible for credit card");
            }
