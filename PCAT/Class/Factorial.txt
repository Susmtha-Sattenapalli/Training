Factorial Calculator:

Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a loop. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is denoted by n! and is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120. Prompt the user to enter a number, then use a loop to calculate and output its factorial.  

public class FactorialUsingWhileLoop {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
          
        //declaring and intializing variables   
        int fact = 1;  
        int i = 1;  
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);  
  
        System.out.println("Enter a number whose factorial is to be found: ");  
        int num = sc.nextInt();  
          

            while( i <= num ){  
            fact = fact * i;   
            i++; 
        }     

        System.out.println("\nFactorial of " + num + " is: " + fact);  
    }  
}
