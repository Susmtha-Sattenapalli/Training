Assignment 1:
Pseudocode and Flowchart for Sorting Algorithm - Write pseudocode and create a flowchart for a bubble sort algorithm. Provide a brief explanation of how the algorithm works and a simple array of integers to demonstrate a dry run of your algorithm

Start
accept n as the length of array
set i as 0
Loop while ( i < n-1):
   set j as 0
    Loop while ( j < n-i-1):
        Check if array[j] > array[j+1]   // if first element is greater than second element swap the 
        If true:                                               two elements
            Swap array[j] and array[j+1]
        Increment j
    Increment i
Return array
End

Dry Run:
Ex;  [ 23,  4, 15, 41, 32]
         [4, 23, 15, 41, 32]    //23 > 4 (swapping)
         [4, 15, 23, 41, 32]     //23 > 15(swapping)
          [4, 15, 23, 41, 32]     //23 is not greater than 41(No swapping)
          [4, 15, ,23, 32, 41]    //41 > 32 (swapping)
Finally ,we will get the sorted order
