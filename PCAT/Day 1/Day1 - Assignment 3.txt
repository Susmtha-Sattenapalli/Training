Assignment 3: 

Function Design and Modularization - Create a document that describes the design of two modular functions: one that returns the factorial of a number, and another that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. Include pseudocode and a brief explanation of how modularity in programming helps with code reuse and organization.

Factorial Function:
 function factorial(n):
 if(n==0)
  return 1
 else
   return n* factorial(n-1)
start
read n
accept n
result=call factorial(n)
print result
end                                              
                                                            
Fibonacci Function:                   
function fib(n)
  if(n<=1)
   return n
  else
   return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
start
read n
accept n
result=call fib(n)
print result
end

***Modularity is the process of breaking down a program into several parts which helps in reuse of different parts of the program whenever needed to achieve easier understanding of the program, scalability, etc.. like we used factorial and fib functions again in the above programs.
